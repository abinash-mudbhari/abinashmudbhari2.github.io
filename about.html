<h1>About me</h1>
<article class="aboutme">
  <p>I have completed my bachelor's degree in civil engineering in 2018. A year of working on civil companies I found civil technicalities wasnâ€™t my cup of tea. I was using the tools of Civil like AUTOCAD, sap, ETABS but I was more fascinated by the tech that was used to create that software. I needed to know how they were built.</p>

     <p class="show">Then I learned about Python. I started learning it and after learning Python, I was completely carried away by it then I knew the framework called Django. I was excited about building my website. I started learning the basics of website building like HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap. In 2019 I got a job as part-time in Website Designing. There I have to use CSS and HTML for frontend development and Django and Python as a Backend. I used to teach Python to some high school students. I did freelancing jobs as a helping agent to built websites of some initial developing companies. Then I learned the basics of JavaScript and jQuery. Now I am partially ready for creating a website. I completely left my Civil Engineering career for the sake of my passion and here I am now learning different Things about Programming Every Day. I am committed to lifelong learning as I am extremely motivated and now I like what I am doing. I came to America in 2020 and I am happy that I would be able to proceed my career with lots of opportunities here.
